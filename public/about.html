<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Well, I'm kind of a boring guy who just sits on a chair and spend his whole time infront of the PC. But yeah like others, I do have some hobbies too (^_^)</p>
    <p>Here are some of my hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Cycling</h2>
            <p>I love exploring my city a lot. And when exploring my own city becomes boring, I start exploring other cities as well. It's actually a very fun thing to do.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Hanging out</h2>
            <p>Hanging out is a very refreshing thing to do. It refreshes my mind a lot. I love to hangout with my friends and family. Talking with them, sharing every moments with them, watching them smiling and having a very good time - refreshes my mind a lot and it really makes me happy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>Gaming is a thing that I can never stop myself from doing that. I'm familiar with gaming since my childhood. When I was at the age of 5, my uncle bought a pc for me ,and there I got introduced with a game called "<b>Road Rash</b>". I loved the game with my heart and I also loved watching other people play that game. Even though I have less time, I still manage to play games. My favorite genre is open world games,where I explore the world inside games and I really enjoy doing that. My all time favorite game is "<b>Red Dead Redemption 2</b> ."</p>
